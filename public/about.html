<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m Vladyslav, a 23-year-old with a strong passion for programming, living in Canada. Ever
  since I discovered the world of coding, I've been fascinated by the endless possibilities it offers.
  While I may not be a seasoned expert yet, I’m incredibly eager to develop my skills and dive deeper
  into the field.</p>

<p>I am constantly learning, whether it’s through personal projects, online courses, or experimenting
  with new technologies. Every line of code I write is a step closer to achieving my goal of becoming
  a professional programmer. I believe that dedication and hard work will allow me to make a
  meaningful impact in the tech world.</p>

<p>I’m especially excited about solving complex problems and finding creative solutions,
  and I know that being a programmer is not just about writing code — it’s about improving the world
  through technology. I can’t wait to land my first role in the industry, where I can apply my
  passion and grow alongside experienced professionals.
  I’m committed to learning every day and pushing myself to be the best programmer I can be.</p>
